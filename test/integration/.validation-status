## Static Validation: ✓ PASSED

Date: 2025-11-13
Validated by: Claude Code (executing-plans skill)

### Files Created and Verified:
- ✓ test/integration/tart-e2e.sh (main orchestrator)
- ✓ test/integration/phases/setup-vm.sh
- ✓ test/integration/phases/install-homebrew.sh
- ✓ test/integration/phases/install-offlinebrew.sh
- ✓ test/integration/phases/create-mirror.sh
- ✓ test/integration/phases/verify-install.sh
- ✓ test/integration/lib/test-helpers.sh
- ✓ test/integration/config/test-packages.txt (5 packages)
- ✓ test/integration/README.md
- ✓ Makefile

### Static Checks Passed:
- ✓ All scripts have executable permissions
- ✓ All bash scripts pass syntax validation (bash -n)
- ✓ Makefile syntax is valid
- ✓ test-packages.txt contains 5 valid package definitions
- ✓ All phase scripts source test-helpers.sh correctly
- ✓ All phase scripts follow consistent structure

### Ready for Execution:
The test suite is ready for execution when Tart is installed.

To run:
```bash
# Ensure Tart is installed
brew install tart

# Run full test suite
make test

# Or run individual phases
make test-mirror
make test-install
```

### Manual Validation Required:
- [ ] Full test execution with Tart (requires 10-20 minutes + optional 20-40GB image download)
- [ ] Verify all 5 phases complete successfully
- [ ] Verify all 5 packages install and verify correctly
- [ ] Verify VM cleanup works on success
- [ ] Verify VM preservation works on failure
- [ ] Verify multiple runs work correctly

## Notes:
All implementation tasks (offlinebrew-3d0.1 through offlinebrew-3d0.12) completed successfully.
Test infrastructure is production-ready pending manual execution validation with Tart.
